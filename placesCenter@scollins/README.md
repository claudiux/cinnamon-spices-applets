Places Center
-------------

Places Center is a feature-rich, cross-platform Cinnamon applet that provides easy access to all of your most-used places.

#### Features
* All entries are file manager independent (which means that they should work for nautilus, nemo, and probably any other file manager as well)
* Option to display all volumes, or just the ones that are mounted
* Supports bookmarks (eg. from Nemo)
* Supports additional user defined places
* Easy to read layout with multiple columns
* Ability to set the panel icon and text (symbolic icons supported)
* Option to show favorite documents
* Option to show recent documents (click on a recent document to open it; right-click to open the folder that contains it)
* Quick keyboard access (choose your shortcut)
* Search tool that allows you to quickly search for files and folders (supports regular expressions)
* Use the middle click to open the folder you have selected (default: your personal home folder).

#### Icon browser

You can install the *yad* package. This will allow you to use the *yad-icon-browser* program to browse icons, choose the one you want, and copy/paste its name.

This icon browser can then be accessed via a button in the User and System tabs of this applet settings.
